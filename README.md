Assignment for KEA MMD 3rd semester:

You are going to re-implement a color palette designer, kind of like Adobeâ€™s Color Wheel on their Adobe Color CC webpage (previously known as Kuler).

This assignment requires conversion of color codes between HEX colors, RGB values, and HSL values. And you'll need to plan how and when you convert from each type.

The user must be able to select a base color - the one in the middle - and then the four other colors are calculated according to the color harmony chosen. The user won't be able to modify the four other colors.

The user must be able to select between these different harmonies: Analogous, Monochromatic, Triad, Complementary, Compound, and Shades
